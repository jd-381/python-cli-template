# Contributing

This guide covers the development workflow, testing, and code quality standards.

## Prerequisites

**Required:** [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager

## Development Setup

### Install Dependencies

```bash
make deps
```

Installs everything you need:
- ✅ Runtime dependencies (Typer)
- ✅ Development dependencies (pytest, ruff, typer-cli, pre-commit)
- ✅ Pre-commit git hooks

**Pre-commit hooks** run automatically before each commit:
- Format code with Ruff
- Lint code with Ruff
- Run the test suite
- Generate documentation (fails if `USAGE.md` was edited manually)
- Baseline checks: trailing whitespace, end-of-file newlines, YAML/TOML validity, merge-conflict markers, large files, private keys

### Validate Setup

```bash
make validate
```

Runs the complete quality check suite:
- ✅ Lint with Ruff (`make lint`)
- ✅ Format with Ruff (`make format`)
- ✅ Test with pytest (`make test`)

Use this to verify your setup or manually validate changes before committing. These are the same checks that pre-commit hooks run.

### Testing the CLI

**During development** - Test without installing:

```bash
uv run template-cli hello --name World
```

**Production testing** - Install and test:

```bash
# Install to ~/.local/bin
make install

# Run the installed CLI
template-cli hello --name World

# After code changes, reinstall with fresh cache
make upgrade
```

**PATH setup:** If the command isn't found, add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Make Commands

Run `make` without arguments to see all available commands.

### Command Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make deps` | Install dependencies and set up git hooks |
| `make validate` | Run lint, format, test, and hooks |
| `make install` | Install CLI globally to `~/.local/bin` |
| `make upgrade` | Reinstall CLI with fresh cache |
| `make docs` | Generate `USAGE.md` documentation |
| `make lint` | Check code with Ruff (no changes) |
| `make format` | Format code with Ruff |
| `make test` | Run test suite with pytest |
| `make hooks` | Run baseline pre-commit hooks (whitespace, YAML/TOML, etc.) |
| `make github` | Configure branch protection (requires GitHub CLI) |

```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Tests are located in `tests/test_*.py` and cover individual commands and services.

```bash
make test
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically before each commit to ensure:
- ✅ Code quality standards (lint and format)
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Documentation is up to date

## Code Style

**Linting and formatting:** Ruff (configured in `pyproject.toml`)

The project follows standard Python conventions with automatic enforcement through pre-commit hooks and CI/CD.
